"""Run configuration.

Every number that can change an outcome lives here, and every run is fully
determined by a `FedConfig`. That is a hard requirement, not a convenience:
the deliverable of this harness is a detection probability and a false-alarm
rate, and neither is meaningful if a run cannot be reproduced exactly.

Seeds are split by concern so that one source of variation can be held fixed
while another is swept:

  partition_seed  which client gets which samples (the non-IID draw)
  init_seed       global model initialisation
  train_seed      batch shuffling and any training-time stochasticity

A fault-injection sweep, for example, holds `partition_seed` fixed so that
detector behaviour is attributable to the injected fault rather than to a
different data split.
